Alter the Perspective A technique we sometimes use in the studio is to turn up the volume on the headphones extremely loud. When every sound explodes in your ears, there’s a natural tendency to play much quieter to restore the balance. It’s a forced perspective change, and can bring out a very delicate performance. Even vocals will be whispered, because anything more than that would be overwhelming.

Conversely, to coax someone to sing louder, with more energy, I might ask them to turn the vocal volume down in their headphones so their voice is drowned out by the music. Whatever the situation, if a task is challenging to accomplish, there’s often a way to design the surroundings to naturally encourage the performance you’re striving for. In a concert, setting up the lighting so that the performer either sees the crowd and the faces in it or can’t see anyone at all will alter the performance. If a performer uses in-ear monitors and all they hear is the music they’re playing and not the audience response, it will be very different than if the screaming of the crowd is mixed in. It’s worth experimenting with different scenarios to observe what they bring out and to find the performance you want.

A quintessential song of female empowerment, “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman” was written by Carole King and Gerry Goffin. King—and then, of course, Aretha Franklin—sang it. I was surprised to learn that Goffin wrote the lyrics and King the music. At times, I will ask the musician to select an artist whose lyrics and point of view are very different from their own, as a way to avoid the sameness that can occur in a career over time. If an artist is normally full of braggadocio, we may choose a more vulnerable, soft-spoken lyricist. If you tend to write in style x, it can be interesting to choose an artist who is the polar opposite of x. This doesn’t mean the song will be good. It’s just interesting to see where it leads.

Add Imagery I was working on an album and the band was struggling with the keyboard solo. The mood wasn’t right. We wanted something more grand. So instead of a musical reference, we created a scene. We came up with a description of the aftermath of a battle: “Imagine there’s a beautiful green hill covered in trees and flora, just breathtaking, and a battle has just ended.

Limit the Information When a songwriter sends a demo of a track for a band to record in the studio, I don’t want the musicians to in any way be informed by the musical choices made for the demo. So I’ll typically have one musician, usually a guitar player, listen to it and learn the chords, notate them on the lyric sheet, and give that to the band. The guitar player and the singer may then perform it, with no suggestion of rhythm other than the speed implied by the way they play it. When you’re working with great musicians, this leaves them free to bring in more of themselves.

We have stories about the work, and those are not what the work is. All our efforts to make sense of ourselves and our art are a smoke screen, an obfuscation. They don’t illuminate what is. They mislead us. We have no way of knowing what is insignificant and what is essential, or what our contributions mean. We tell ourselves varying stories of who we are and how the work gets made.

The artwork is the point where all the elements come together—the universe, the prism of self, the magic and discipline of transmuting idea to flesh. And if these lead you into contradiction—into territories that seem unbridgeable or unknowable—that doesn’t mean they aren’t harmonious. Even in perceived chaos, there is order and pattern.
